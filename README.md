# AI-Based Disk Scheduling Simulator

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered disk scheduling simulator that allows users to visualize and compare different disk scheduling algorithms. It provides an interactive interface to analyze the performance of algorithms such as FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, LOOK, and an AI-based approach.

## Features
- **Algorithm Selection**: Choose from FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, LOOK, and AI-Based scheduling.
- **Interactive Simulation**: Enter disk requests and visualize head movement.
- **Performance Metrics**: Track seek time, response time, and throughput.
- **Configurable Workloads**: Simulate random and sequential request patterns.
- **Progress Indicator**: Monitor the simulation progress in real-time.
- **Comparison Table**: View historical performance of different algorithms.
- **Save & Load Configurations**: Store and restore simulation settings.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Frontend development and visualization.
- **Canvas API**: Graphical representation of disk head movement.
- **LocalStorage API**: Save and load user configurations.

## How to Use
1. Open the `disk_scheduling_AI.html` file in a web browser.
2. Select a scheduling algorithm from the dropdown menu.
3. Set the initial head position and disk request sequence.
4. Click **Start** to run the simulation.
5. Use **Pause**, **Resume**, and **Reset** to control the execution.
6. View performance metrics and comparison history.
7. Save configurations for future use.

## Installation
No installation is required. Simply open the HTML file in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
